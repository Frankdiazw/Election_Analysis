## Overview of Project
This document focuses on reporting the election results for an election audit of the tabulated results for U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. Using python to import the tabulated results to the IDE and showcase the election results to a text file. In this document, a series of votes were processed and filtered to obtain the total number of votes, the number of votes each candidate obtained and their percentage, and the majority winner of the Colorado elections. Excel is commonly used for this type of data, but in this case an automation of it was sought in Python in order to be able to use this code for other and future elections.

- **Figure 1. Election Results shown in the Terminal of Visual Studio Code.**

In base of the Figure above and the program made for this elections, five analysis can be obtained from the electoral precint:
- A variable was created to store the number of votes in it (integer data type), a for loop was created in the Excel row to count the number of votes in the elections, resulting in: 369, 711 votes.
  - The function: total_votes + = 1 was used to count the number of votes that there were during the elections.
